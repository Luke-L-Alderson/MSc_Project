# MSc_Project
 
This code comprises the practical element of my MSc Thesis titled: A Characterisation of Convolutional Spiking Autoencoders.

.csv files in the main directory are used to generate plots in the plotting.py and plotting_freqs.py files.

The remaining files are a mixture of imports for the code in the main.py file, and supplementary visualisation tool for various datasets including MNIST, DVS, and SHD. The main.py file is configured to work with Weights and Biases (wandb), a cloud-based machine learning experiment platform, and will require reconfiguration to run locally.
