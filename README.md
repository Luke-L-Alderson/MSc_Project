This code comprises the practical element of my MSc Thesis titled: A Characterisation of Convolutional Spiking Autoencoders.

.csv files in the main directory are used to generate plots in the plotting.py and plotting_freqs.py files.

The remaining files are a mixture of imports for the code in the main.py file, and supplementary visualisation tool for various datasets including MNIST, DVS, and SHD.
